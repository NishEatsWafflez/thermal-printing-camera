Python script to control a ZJ-58 thermal printer using a Raspberry Pi

To use, install Pillow and pycups, and then move a photo into the folder. Modify the input image name to match the photo and run the script.

**Future Plans**: Rewrite/Create alternative script that uses Raspberry Pi connected to camera module and button to take a photo and instantly print it.
